# Planetary-Orbit-Simulator
This is a standalone C++ script that simulates a circular orbit given a star and a planet.
## How it works
This simple script askes the user for three inputs; mass of the planet, mass of the star and, distance between them. The script then uses Newtons gravitatonal and equates it with the centripetal force needed for the body to stay in orbit. This gives the required angular velocity for the planet. The sccript uses Graphics.h library to render and animate the moving orbit of the planet. The volume of the bodies are not to scale, as it would be an inconvinience in this 2d simulator. 
## How to run the script
Download the single cpp file and make sure you have the required dependencies installed in your system, here, graphics.h. With any compiler, you can simply execute the script and you will have it running. You can also download the executable file directly, make sure you have the dependencies installed.
